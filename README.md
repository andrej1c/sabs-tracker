# sabs-tracker

This is a WordPress plugin that was developed for the South Atlanta Bike Shop to track points each student earns and spends as well as details about each activity. It can be used for any program that needs to track earning and spending points.

It is a basic plugin that:

* Only allows access to logged in users
* Adds a "Points" field to the post edit screen. We add each student as a category so each post is an entry for a particular day. pot categories as student names so that we can easily view history of a particular student by viewing the category archive.
* Allows you to view the aggregate report by inserting a shortcode to any page: [sabs_report]
