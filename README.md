# SABS Tracker

This is a WordPress plugin that was developed for the South Atlanta Bike Shop to track points each student earns and spends as well as details about each activity. It can be used for any program that needs to track earning and spending points.

It is a basic plugin that:

* Only allows access to logged in users
* Adds a "Points" field to the post edit screen. We added each student as a category so each post is an entry for a particular day for a particular student. Sometimes if a group of students participated in the same activity with the same amount of points, you can use one post and select multiple categories.
* When viewing a category archive each post also displays the points associated
* Allows you to view the aggregate report by inserting a shortcode to any page: [sabs_report]
