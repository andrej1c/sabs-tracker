# SABS Tracker

This is a WordPress plugin that was developed for the South Atlanta Bike Shop to track points each student earns and spends as well as details about each activity. It can be used for any program that needs to track earning and spending points.

## Features

* Each post is an activity journal for one or more students with points added or subtracted 
* View details history of individual students
* View aggregate report showing current status of points of everybody in the program
* Limits access to logged in users (no public access)

## Installation and Setup

* Upload and activate this plugin
* Add "Youth" category. You can actually call it anything that fits your program. The reason here is that you can have multiple categories of users, such as "volunteers" or "staff"
* Create a sub-category for each student
* Create a page called "Report" and insert a shortcode [sabs_report] into the page body
* (Optional) Create a menu with two items: Home and Points Report
* (Optional) Add a sidebar widget listing all categories. This gives you quick access to detailed history of individual students

## Usage Tips

* Sometimes if a group of students participated in the same activity with the same amount of points, you can use one post and select multiple categories.
* Whenever the amount of points is outside of the ordinary, use the post content to give details. This helps explain the students the reasons long after you've forgoten.
